# Renamer

Batch files renamer (rename multiple files name simutenously)

# What's this for?

Maybe not for any normal user but `Textual Inversion Embedding` trainer who will, most likely, find themselves struggle to rename all the result files
> Take a look at the [demo](https://github.com/Meonako/renamer/edit/master/README.md#demo) section

# Usage

1. Run the executable
2. Enter the target directory
3. Enter the text you want it to disappear from your life (jk)
4. Enter the text you want to see as a result
